## Trading Strategy (CORRECTED - 2026-04-08)

### Exit Rules (UPDATED - trailing stop):
```
+35% → Sell initial investment (~74% of position — recovers 0.05 SOL)
Remaining ~26%: TRAILING STOP — sell if 20% drop from peak
⚠️ Stop: -25%
```

### Alert Format:
- Telegram uses HTML mode (Markdown fails on emoji → HTTP 400)
- Entry/Exit mcap on all sells
- PnL with green/red emoji
- Clickable links (plain URLs)
- No signal alerts - only BUY/SELL executed

### Trade Report Format (Chris approved):
- Last 5 trades (NOT 10)
- Open positions with live mcap + link
- Balance + record
- Buy mcap + sell mcap + timestamps
- Green/red emoji
- All links clickable

### Auto Monitor:
`position_monitor.py` runs every 60s checking TP/stop hits
`auto_scanner.py` runs every 90s scanning for buys
`alert_sender.py` runs every 30s sending Telegram alerts

## Chris (@please grow good weed):
- Trading style: Aggressive, wants action not analysis
- Rule: "Either buy or pass - no presenting signals"
- Wants continuous scanning and trading
- Prefers fast decisions over perfect analysis
- Very detail-oriented on alert/report format

## Trading Lessons Learned
- NODES bought 6 times in one day, stopped out 4x → ~0.15 SOL lost to repeat chasing
- Re-entry lockout added: no re-buy of stopped tokens within 30 min unless strong momentum (bs 3.0+, chg 60%+)
- Markdown mode in Telegram fails with certain emoji → use HTML mode
- .last_alert_index can go stale and cause missed alerts → must sync to actual trade count
- Position monitor and sim_trader had hardcoded wrong thresholds → must use trading_constants
- TP2 threshold of +95% is too high — only 3 trades hit it in 110. Winners avg +54% but we only capture +35% at TP1
- Scanner is catching dumps (both winners and losers use MOMENTUM) — same signal, different outcome = timing/luck
- WORTHLESS incident: Stale GMGN signal (6 days old) bought wrong token = -31%. Signal age check is MANDATORY
- Liquidity $0 on DexScreener means rugged — need liquidity minimum check BEFORE buying
- GMGN signal `ca` field can be null — code must fall back to `token_address` field
- Scanner buys into late-stage momentum ($5K-$13K mcap with high 5-min % gains) — tokens dump immediately after entry

## Trading Patterns
See `/root/.openclaw/workspace/trading-patterns.md` for full analysis

## Win Rate
- Current WR: 22% (40W/126L) - improving
- Scanner filters were too loose — MOMENTUM signal fires on both winners and losers
- GMGN signals are mostly noise — PUMP signals dominate but rarely translate to wins
- Need: better entry confirmation, not just MOMENTUM scan

## Entry Criteria (UPDATED per Chris)
- Mcap: $5K-$100K
- 24h volume: $10K+
- 5min volume: $1K+
- Buy/sell ratio: 1.5+
- Holders: 15+
- Pump.fun only
- 30 min re-entry lockout after any close
- Liquidity minimum: $1,000 (reject if less — rugged/illiquid)
- Signal age: Max 5 minutes (reject stale signals)
- Contract address validation: Signal CA must match DexScreener response

## Whales Tracked
- GH9yk8vgFvHnAD8JZqXxr3hBN1Lr1mJ9NPzrP5mVqiJe (Chris-added 2026-04-08)
- 4 others tracked in wallet_analysis/whale_wallets.jsonl

## Dual Scanner System (2026-04-08)
1. `auto_scanner.py` - DexScreener native scan, 90s, scans 30 newest tokens
2. `gmgn_buyer.py` - GMGN signal native, 60s, acts on high-quality signals (score 50+)
Both run simultaneously. GMGN buyer is smarter - uses LP burn, holder concentration, age data.

## GMGN Signal Scorer (built 2026-04-08)
Scores signals 0-100 based on:
- Liquidity (0-25 pts): higher = better
- Holders (0-20 pts): more decentralized = better
- Top 10% concentration (0-15 pts): lower = better
- LP burnt (10 pts): yes = safer
- Safety flags (10 pts): no_mint + no_blacklist
- Age (0-10 pts): 5-30min sweet spot
- Volume ratio (0-10 pts): vol/mcap high = strong interest
- Action multiplier: KOL_BUY (1.5x), KOTH (1.3x), PUMP (1.0x)

Top recent scores: MOCUS 76, GURU 73, GATSBY 72

## GMGN Buyer Critical Fixes (2026-04-14)

### Stale Signal Bug - WORTHLESS Incident
- gmgn signal file `gmgn_WORTH_4414872.json` was 6 DAYS old (parsed_at: 2026-04-08)
- gmgn_buyer processed ALL signal files with no age check
- Signal had `ca`=null, fell back to `token_address` correctly
- WORTH token CA was 8tKWk9... but DexScreener lookup returned WORTHLESS at 27VDTV... (different contract!)
- gmgn_buyer bought WORTHLESS at $10,391 → stopped at $7,120 (-31%)
- **Root cause**: No signal age check + no CA validation + stale signal sat in signals/ for 6 days

### Fixes Applied (2026-04-14):
1. **Signal age check**: gmgn_buyer now skips signals with `parsed_at` > 5 minutes old
2. **Contract address validation**: Before buying, verify signal CA matches DexScreener `baseToken.address`
3. **MIN_GMGN_API_SCORE → MIN_GMGN_SCORE** (was undefined, would crash or use wrong threshold)
4. **Liquidity minimum $1K**: Both scanners reject tokens with <$1K liquidity (rugged/illiquid)
5. **Deleted stale signals**: Removed 6-day-old WORTH signal file

### Scanner Crashes - Missing Constants
- auto_scanner.py crashed repeatedly with ImportError
- Missing from trading_constants.py: `MIN_VOLUME`, `MIN_BS_RATIO`, `ATH_DIVERGENCE_REJECT`, `NEW_PUMP_HS1_THRESHOLD`, `MIN_GMGN_SCORE`, `GMGN_VOL_MCAP_MIN`
- All added and scanners restarted

## Strategy Updates (2026-04-14)
- MIN_CHG1_FOR_BUY: 3.0 → 5.0 (need stronger hourly momentum)
- Cooldown thresholds already at v6.1 levels (NEW_PUMP_5M=50%, OLD_PUMP_5M=1%)

## Fresh Reset (2026-04-14 05:30 UTC)
Chris reset everything after bad run:
- sim_wallet.json → 1.0 SOL
- stats → 0 trades / 0W / 0L
- position_peak_cache.json → {}
- integrity_state.json → reset
- SIM_RESET_TIMESTAMP → 2026-04-14T05:31:26
- MARS manually closed at -100% (open position)
- All scanners stopped
