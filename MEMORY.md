## Trading Strategy (CORRECTED - 2026-04-08)

### Exit Rules (UPDATED - trailing stop):
```
+35% → Sell 70%
Remaining 30%: TRAILING STOP — sell if 20% drop from peak
⚠️ Stop: -25%
```

### Alert Format:
- Telegram uses HTML mode (Markdown fails on emoji → HTTP 400)
- Entry/Exit mcap on all sells
- PnL with green/red emoji
- Clickable links (plain URLs)
- No signal alerts - only BUY/SELL executed

### Trade Report Format (Chris approved):
- Last 5 trades (NOT 10)
- Open positions with live mcap + link
- Balance + record
- Buy mcap + sell mcap + timestamps
- Green/red emoji
- All links clickable

### Auto Monitor:
`position_monitor.py` runs every 60s checking TP/stop hits
`auto_scanner.py` runs every 90s scanning for buys
`alert_sender.py` runs every 30s sending Telegram alerts

## Chris (@please grow good weed):

- Wants continuous scanning and trading
- Prefers fast decisions over perfect analysis
- Very detail-oriented on alert/report format

## Trading Lessons Learned
- NODES bought 6 times in one day, stopped out 4x → ~0.15 SOL lost to repeat chasing
- Re-entry lockout added: no re-buy of stopped tokens within 30 min unless strong momentum (bs 3.0+, chg 60%+)
- Markdown mode in Telegram fails with certain emoji → use HTML mode
- .last_alert_index can go stale and cause missed alerts → must sync to actual trade count
- Position monitor and sim_trader had hardcoded wrong thresholds → must use trading_constants
- TP2 threshold of +95% is too high — only 3 trades hit it in 110. Winners avg +54% but we only capture +35% at TP1
- Scanner is catching dumps (both winners and losers use MOMENTUM) — same signal, different outcome = timing/luck

## Trading Patterns
See `/root/.openclaw/workspace/trading-patterns.md` for full analysis

## Win Rate Problem
- Current WR: 18% (20W/90L)
- Scanner filters were too loose — MOMENTUM signal fires on both winners and losers
- GMGN signals are mostly noise — PUMP signals dominate but rarely translate to wins
- Need: better entry confirmation, not just MOMENTUM scan

## Entry Criteria (UPDATED - tightened based on data)
- Mcap: $5K-$50K (winners: $5,206-$52,976)
- Volume: $20K+ (winners had $20K+)
- Buy/sell ratio: 1.5+
- 24h change: 15%+
- Holders: 50+ (if available)
- Pump.fun only
- 30 min re-entry lockout after any close
- NODES bought 6 times in one day, stopped out 4x → ~0.15 SOL lost to repeat chasing
- Re-entry lockout added: no re-buy of stopped tokens within 30 min unless strong momentum (bs 2.5+, chg 50%+)
- Markdown mode in Telegram fails with certain emoji → use HTML mode
- .last_alert_index can go stale and cause missed alerts → must sync to actual trade count
- Position monitor and sim_trader had hardcoded wrong thresholds → must use trading_constants
